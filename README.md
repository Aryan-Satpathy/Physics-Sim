# Physics Sim in Python
 
## Things that I have planned, as of now, to simulate 

    - Rope (with / without wind)
    - Cloth (with / without wind)
    - Fluid (incompressible, basically liquid)

## Progress 

    - [x] Rope (with / without wind)
    - [ ] Cloth (with / without wind)
    - [ ] Fluid (incompressible, basically liquid)

## Applications

    - Could be used to understand some "not so obvious" behaviour of rope/cloth/fluid.
    - Could be used in some python made game directly, without any additional effort.
